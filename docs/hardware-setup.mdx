## Prerequisites

This chapter has no specific prerequisites. It is designed to be a starting point for your hardware journey.

## Introduction to Robotics Hardware

Physical AI and robotics involve a fascinating blend of mechanical, electrical, and software engineering. The hardware forms the physical body of your robot, enabling it to interact with the real world. This section will provide an overview of the essential hardware components you'll encounter.

## Key Hardware Components

Robotic systems typically consist of several core hardware components:

### 1. Actuators
Actuators are the "muscles" of a robot, responsible for generating motion.
- **Motors (DC, Servo, Stepper):** Used to control movement. DC motors are simple, servos provide precise angular control, and stepper motors offer precise positional control.
- **Hydraulic/Pneumatic Cylinders:** Used in heavy-duty applications for strong linear motion.

### 2. Sensors
Sensors are the "eyes and ears" of a robot, providing data about its environment and internal state.
- **Encoders:** Measure rotational position or velocity of motors.
- **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units):** Provide orientation and acceleration data (gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers).
- **Lidars/Radars:** Used for distance sensing, mapping, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Cameras:** Provide visual data for object recognition, navigation, and human-robot interaction.
- **Force/Torque Sensors:** Measure forces and torques applied to the robot's end-effectors.

### 3. Microcontrollers and Single-Board Computers (SBCs)
These are the "brains" of the robot, processing sensor data and sending commands to actuators.
- **Microcontrollers (e.g., Arduino):** Simple, low-power devices for direct control of motors and sensors.
- **Single-Board Computers (e.g., Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson):** More powerful, capable of running operating systems like Linux, complex AI algorithms, and robotics frameworks.

### 4. Power Systems
Robots need power! This includes batteries, power distribution boards, and voltage regulators.

## Hardware Integration with Robotics Frameworks

Modern robotics largely relies on sophisticated software frameworks to manage hardware complexities.

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It provides tools, libraries, and conventions for developing complex robotic applications.
- **Nodes:** ROS 2 applications are composed of nodes, which are individual processes.
- **Topics:** Nodes communicate by sending messages over named topics.
- **Services:** For request/reply interactions.
- **Actions:** For long-running tasks.

Integrating hardware with ROS 2 often involves writing drivers that can publish sensor data to ROS topics and subscribe to command topics to control actuators.

### NVIDIA Isaac
NVIDIA Isaac is a platform for accelerated robotics development, focusing on simulation, perception, and AI. It provides a rich set of tools and SDKs, especially for robots equipped with NVIDIA Jetson platforms.
- **Isaac Sim:** A scalable robotics simulation application and synthetic data generation tool.
- **Isaac SDK:** A collection of robotics algorithms and tools.

## General Principles for Hardware Setup

- **Modularity:** Design your system with modular components, making troubleshooting and upgrades easier.
- **Cable Management:** Keep wiring neat and organized to prevent interference and damage.
- **Power Budgeting:** Ensure your power supply can handle the peak current draw of all components.
- **Safety First:** Always consider safety, especially when dealing with powerful motors or heavy robotic arms. Use emergency stop buttons and proper guarding.
- **Documentation:** Document your hardware connections, component specifications, and any custom modifications.
