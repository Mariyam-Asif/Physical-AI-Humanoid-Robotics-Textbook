# 5. APA-Style Citation Formatting Rules

## Context
To ensure academic rigor, consistency, and proper attribution of all sources within the AI Robotics textbook, especially given potential AI-generated content, a standardized citation style is necessary.

## Decision
All references and citations within the textbook content will strictly adhere to APA-style formatting rules.
*   Standard: APA Style.
*   Scope: All in-text citations and reference lists.
*   Enforcement: Content review and validation guidelines.

## Consequences
*   **Pros**: Ensures academic rigor, consistency across the textbook, proper attribution of sources, maintains credibility and trustworthiness of the technical content, reduced plagiarism risk, professional presentation.
*   **Cons**: Requires meticulous attention to detail from authors and reviewers, potential for formatting errors if not supported by automated tooling or strict guidelines, may require training for content creators unfamiliar with APA style.

## Alternatives
*   Other academic citation styles (e.g., MLA, Chicago, IEEE).
*   Less strict or informal citation methods (risk of inconsistency and reduced credibility).
