# Prompt History Record

## User Prompt

```
please resume creating quickstart.md file in the specs folder.
```

## Assistant Response

```
I'm going to use the TodoWrite tool to write the following items to the todo list:
- Create quickstart.md in the specs folder

I'm now going to use the Glob tool to check if specs/quickstart.md already exists.
```
