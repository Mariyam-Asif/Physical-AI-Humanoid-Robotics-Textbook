# Introduction to ROS 2

<Callout type="learning-objectives">
**Learning Objectives:**
*   Understand the core concepts of ROS 2.
*   Identify the main components of a ROS 2 system.
*   Set up a basic ROS 2 development environment.
</Callout>

**Prerequisites:** None for this introductory chapter.

## Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of Module 1, where we delve into the world of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software, providing a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental concepts of ROS 2, its architecture, and how to get your development environment set up.

## Core Content: Understanding ROS 2

ROS 2 builds upon the success of its predecessor, ROS 1, but with significant improvements designed for production robotics. It addresses challenges related to real-time performance, security, and multi-robot systems.

### Key Concepts

*   **Nodes**: Executable processes that perform computation.
*   **Topics**: Named buses over which nodes exchange messages.
*   **Messages**: Data structures used by topics.
*   **Services**: Request/reply communication between nodes.
*   **Actions**: Long-running tasks with feedback and cancellability.

### Code Block Standards

Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers, line numbers, copy buttons, and optional highlighting.

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Always ensure your ROS 2 environment is sourced correctly before running any ROS 2 commands. You can add `source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash` to your `~/.bashrc` file for convenience.
</Callout>

## Hands-On Exercise (Optional)

<Exercise id="ros2-install" title="Install ROS 2 Foxy" solution="Follow the official ROS 2 Foxy installation guide for your operating system (Ubuntu recommended). Verify the installation by running `ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker` and `ros2 run demo_nodes_py listener`." difficulty="easy" estimated_time="30 min">
  <p>**Problem Statement:** Install ROS 2 Foxy distribution on your development machine and verify its basic functionality.</p>
  <p>**Starter Code:** (No starter code, as this is an installation exercise)</p>
```bash
# Start here: official ROS 2 Foxy installation guide
```
  <details>
    <summary>Hint 1</summary>
    <p>The official documentation is the best place to start. Look for the \"Foxy Fitzroy\" distribution.</p>
  </details>
</Exercise>

<KeyTakeaways>
**Key Takeaways:**
*   ROS 2 is a robust framework for robotic software development.
*   Its architecture relies on concepts like nodes, topics, messages, services, and actions.
*   Proper environment setup is crucial for ROS 2 development.
</KeyTakeaways>

## Summary

This chapter provided an initial overview of ROS 2, covering its core concepts, architecture, and basic installation. You should now have a foundational understanding of what ROS 2 is and how to begin setting up your development environment. In the next chapters, we will dive deeper into specific ROS 2 components and programming patterns.
