## Prompt

Please proceed with the implementation process. Stop bulk generation. Do implementation in small batches. Create only 1–2 files per step. you have completed phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3, now move on to the next phase 4, t036.

## Response snapshot

Acknowledged request to proceed with Phase 4, T036. I will now add T036 to the todo list and start working on it, focusing on small batches and 1-2 files per step.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Initiated implementation for T036, focusing on controlled, incremental changes.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run yet for this specific task.
- 📁 Files: Created PHR for this prompt.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with implementation of T036.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully identified the next task (T036) from tasks.md and created a PHR to document the prompt and initial response.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): null
